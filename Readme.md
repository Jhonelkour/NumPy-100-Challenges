# 🧠 NumPy Practice Journey

After completing the **"Introduction à l'informatique numérique avec NumPy"** tutorial by **Alex Chabot-Leclerc** (SciPy 2019), I decided to keep practicing and improving my skills by solving  **100 Python NumPy Problems** —ranging from easy to difficult.

## ✅ Phase 1: Completed

 **Tutorial** : [Introduction à l&#39;informatique numérique avec NumPy | SciPy 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI)

 **Instructor** : Alex Chabot-Leclerc

🗂️ This phase is documented and pushed to another repository on my GitHub.

## 🚀 Phase 2: 100 NumPy Exercises

I'm currently working through the excellent exercise set from the following repo:

* 📦  **Original Problems Repo** : [rougier/numpy-100](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100.git)
* ✅  **Solution Reference** : [KeithGalli/numpy-100](https://github.com/KeithGalli/numpy-100)

I cloned the repo to my desktop and started working on solving the problems. I’m solving the problems in order, committing frequently to track my learning and progress.
